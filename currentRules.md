# Rules
*VERSION 1.1 - NOVEMBER, 2018*

## KEY CONCEPTS
This section introduces a number of foundational concepts to keep in
mind while playing the game.

### THE GOLDEN RULE
If the text of a card directly contradicts the text of the rules, the text of
the card takes precedence.
### OBJECTIVE
During the game, players use their cards to collect Æmber. Players use
Æmber to forge keys. The game ends immediately when a player forges
their third key, and that player wins the game.
### READY AND EXHAUSTED
Cards that are in play exist in one of two states.

**Ready** cards are oriented upright so that their text may be read from left
to right. A ready card can be used during a player’s turn, causing it to
exhaust.

**Exhausted** cards are rotated 90 degrees to the side. An exhausted card
is not able to be used until it is readied by a game step or card ability.

**All creatures and artifacts enter play exhausted.**

### RUNNING OUT OF TOKENS OR STATUS CARDS
There is no limit to the number of damage tokens, Æmber tokens, or
status cards that can be in the game area at a given time. If there is a
shortage of the provided tokens or status cards, other tokens, counters,
or coins may be used to track the game state.


## GAME SETUP
To set up the game, perform the following steps, in order:

1. Place all damage tokens, Æmber tokens, and status cards in a common
supply within easy reach of both players.

2. Each player places their identity card to the left or right side of their
play area.

3. Each player places three key tokens, one of each color, with the
unforged side faceup near their identity card.

4. Randomly determine who is the first player. That player takes the first
turn when the game begins. (If players are playing a series of games
between two decks, in each game after the first, the player who used
the deck that was defeated in the previous game chooses who is the
first player.)

5. Each player shuffles their deck and offers it to the opponent for
additional shuffling and/or a final cut.

6. The first player draws a **starting hand of seven cards**. The other player
draws a **starting hand of six cards**.

7. Each player, starting with the first player, has one opportunity to
**mulligan** their starting hand by shuffling it back into their deck and
drawing a new starting hand with one fewer card in it. (This step is
skipped in the Quickstart game.)

**The game is now ready to begin.**

## TURN SEQUENCE
The game is played over a series of turns. Players alternate taking turns
until one player wins the game.
Each turn consists of five steps:
1. Forge a key.

2. Choose a house.

3. Play, discard, and use cards of the chosen house.

4. Ready cards.

5. Draw cards.

**The player taking a turn is referred to as the active player**. The active
player is the only player that can perform actions or make decisions; a
player does not make any decisions when it is not their turn.
Each step is described in the following sections.
